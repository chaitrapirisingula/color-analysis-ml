# Color Analysis with Machine Learning
This is a python program that can simulate different types of colorblindness and determine accessibility of images or websites. By utilizing KMeans, numpy, and OpenCV this program can detect colors in images, determine the amount of contrast between colors, simulate numerous types of color-blindness, and recolor images to improve accessibility. 

See the jupyter notebook files to view the results or try the program out for yourself.
